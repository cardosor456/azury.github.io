	<p>I cleared Final Fantasy 16. Clearing it took me 56 hours. The image of turn based JRPGs is very strong in the Final Fantasy series, but this time it is an action RPG, so it feels like the image is different now.</p>

	<p>If you're thinking, "Why did it become an action RPG?", there are two reasons.
	One, it was made by the producer and director of Final Fantasy 14, an online RPG, so it wouldn't be fun to create a similar RPG.
	Two, the action RPG God of War Ragnarok won the Playstation Blog Game Of The Year 2022 in 10 out of 16 categories. I'm pretty sure Final Fantasy 16 is Yoshida Naoki making his version of God Of War... and I've explained that speedy development of continuous game content (DLC) is an influence.</p>

	<p>As for the story, the middle age Europe style setting which plays out like Game Of Thrones was something I didn't expect. Multiple countries making invading the continent their political strategy, which the protagonist is at the mercy of.</p>

	<p>One fun point was the story and setting, but because of that, overseas game review sites were shitting on the game before it had come out. Websites that evaluate diversity were putting emphasis on things like "there are no black people in this game", and were giving it low scores before even playing the game.</p>

	<p>And, the reason why there are no black people in the game is a spoiler, but it's because the story deals with slavery. It is a story of a world where people with a certain attribute are put into slavery, killing them by working them to the bone and where human trafficking is practiced. So because of that, if real black people made an appearance in the game, it would become a very complicated situation. "This character is black, so he's a slave?" and so on. For that reason, FF16's characters are not in the style of asians, or black people, or hispanic. It's not because of the race's appearance, but because of the irrationality of people who have been discriminated against who are trying to stop that.</p>

	<p>Its a result of not aiming the story at children, it's a game set in a fantasy world so I think it's fine to have a setting that doesn't reflect reality.</p>

	<p>Games and movies are rated after having experienced them, and rating movies before having seen them, or rating games before having played them is pretty rude... that's the way I think at least.</p>
